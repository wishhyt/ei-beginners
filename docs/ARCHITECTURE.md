# Architecture

## Goal
Define a clear, modular architecture for embodied planning, execution, evaluation, and RL experimentation.

## Concepts
- `TaskSpec`: structured task input
- `ActionPlan`: strict symbolic plan generated by planner
- `ExecutionTrace`: executable events and final state
- `EvaluationReport`: EAI-style metric summary

## Implementation
- `ei_beginners.embodied.planning`: rule/llm planner implementations
- `ei_beginners.embodied.execution`: simulation + robot API + action executor
- `ei_beginners.embodied.evaluation`: metrics and reporting
- `ei_beginners.pipelines.plan_execute_eval`: orchestration
- `ei_beginners.rl`: DQN/PPO/SAC/BC baselines

## Results
- deterministic baseline pipeline with rule planner
- optional LLM planner integration
- unified CLI for all workflows

## Next Steps
- add richer task parsing and constraint-aware planning
- add stronger physics backend and scene randomization
- extend evaluator with finer-grained failure attribution
