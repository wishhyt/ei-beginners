# Learning Path

## Goal
Preserve the full learning process while evolving into a production-ready structure.

## Phases
1. **Phase 01: PyBullet Foundations**
   - basic simulation setup
   - kinematics notes
   - Panda pick-and-place implementation
2. **Phase 02: RL Foundations**
   - Gymnasium API and wrappers
   - tabular RL examples
   - legacy SB3 training script
3. **Phase 03: Embodied Control**
   - original homework implementation for interactive robot control
   - source material for refactoring into modular embodied stack
4. **Phase 04: EAI Evaluation**
   - sample prompt/answer fixtures
   - evaluation workflow notes

## Results
- historical learning assets are preserved in place
- new reusable modules are implemented under `src/ei_beginners`

## Next Steps
- add phase-level experiment logs in standardized Markdown reports
- add comparative benchmark tables across planners and policies
