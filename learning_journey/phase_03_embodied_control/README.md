# Phase 03: Embodied Control

## Goal
Capture the original embodied control homework as the source for modular refactoring.

## Concepts
- scene simulation
- object-centric API design
- interactive natural-language-driven execution

## Implementation
- `original_hw5_task1/`: preserved original implementation

## Results
- complete baseline retained for historical traceability

## Next Steps
- incrementally map old monolithic modules to `embodied/planning`, `execution`, and `evaluation`
