# RL Foundations Notes

## Goal
Capture core Gymnasium and RL training concepts used in this learning phase.

## Concepts
- environment loop: `reset -> step -> done`
- spaces: `Discrete`, `Box`, `Dict`, `Tuple`
- wrappers for time limits, observation transforms, logging, and video
- reward signals and termination vs truncation semantics

## Implementation
- basic random-agent loops for environment familiarization
- wrapper-based environment customization
- progressive migration from tabular methods to deep RL tooling

## Results
A practical RL baseline foundation was established for later embodied tasks.

## Next Steps
Unify all RL experiments under consistent training entrypoints and artifact policies.
