# Phase 02: RL Foundations

## Goal
Build RL understanding from Gymnasium basics to algorithmic training workflows.

## Concepts
- environment API lifecycle
- exploration-exploitation tradeoff
- tabular and deep RL baselines

## Implementation
- `gymnasium_basics/`: environment and wrapper experiments
- `cartpole_project/`: Q-learning based CartPole project
- `sb3_train_legacy.py`: historical deep RL training script
- `notes.md`: structured RL notes

## Results
- clear progression from introductory examples to training pipeline thinking

## Next Steps
- unify RL experiments under `src/ei_beginners/rl`
