# Phase 01: PyBullet Foundations

## Goal
Learn simulation basics, coordinate transforms, and grasping control in PyBullet.

## Concepts
- environment setup and simulation stepping
- forward and inverse kinematics
- PD control and IK-based motion

## Implementation
- `panda_pick_and_place.py`: Panda pick-place demonstration
- `code_samples/`: exploratory PyBullet scripts
- `notes/`: translated and structured robotics notes

## Results
- foundational manipulation and simulation skills established

## Next Steps
- port selected scripts into reusable library components
