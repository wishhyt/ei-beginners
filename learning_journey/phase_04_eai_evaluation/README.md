# Phase 04: EAI Evaluation

## Goal
Preserve and operationalize EAI-style prompt/response evaluation fixtures.

## Concepts
- action sequencing evaluation
- executability vs goal satisfaction
- partial success scoring

## Implementation
- `samples/`: prompt and output fixtures
- workflow notes for dataset/evaluator usage

## Results
- canonical sample fixtures for integration tests and demos

## Next Steps
- add multi-task benchmark loop and aggregated reporting
